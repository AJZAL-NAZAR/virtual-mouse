# virtual-mouse
-The Virtual Mouse is an innovative human-computer interaction system that enables users to control cursor movements and perform click operations using hand gestures instead of traditional input devices like a physical mouse. This project leverages computer vision techniques and real-time image processing to detect and track hand gestures via a standard webcam. By using libraries such as OpenCV and MediaPipe, the system identifies hand landmarks and interprets specific finger positions to simulate mouse movements and actions such as left-click, right-click, and scroll. The primary goal of this project is to provide a touchless, intuitive, and accessible alternative for users with physical disabilities or those seeking hands-free control in specific environments. The system demonstrates high accuracy and responsiveness, offering a practical solution for gesture-based control in both personal and professional computing contexts.
